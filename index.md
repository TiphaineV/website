I am a postdoctoral researcher in the A3 team, at LIPN, Paris, since October 2019, where I am focusing on pattern mining in large attributed graphs.
My research interests are broadly located at the interplay of graphs and machine learning, and in how graph-based methods can help us towards more explainable and diverse machine learning.


Before LIPN, I have been a postdoctral researcher ar the Riken Center of Advanced Intelligence Project (AIP), working broadly on the interplay between graphs and machine learning.
I have been a postdoctoral researcher at CNAM, Paris, working with Raphaël Fournier-S'niehotta on social recommender systems; even before, I was a PhD student at LIP6, under the supervision of Matthieu Latapy and Clémence Magnien. My thesis topic was about event detection in interaction streams. More precisely, my goal is to participate to the elaboration of a theoretical framework to describe streams of interactions, and to apply these mathematical tools to anomaly detection in IP traffic.

I am broadly interested in **recommender systems, interaction streams modelisation, data analysis**, and **anomaly detection**
