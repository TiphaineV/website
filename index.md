I am a postdoctoral researcher at Riken AIP, Tokyo, in the Discrete Optimization Unit since April 2018.

Before that, I have been a postdoctoral researcher at CNAM, Paris, working with Raphaël Fournier-S'niehotta on social recommender systems; even before, I was a PhD student at LIP6, under the supervision of Matthieu Latapy and Clémence Magnien. My thesis topic was about event detection in interaction streams. More precisely, my goal is to participate to the elaboration of a theoretical framework to describe streams of interactions, and to apply these mathematical tools to anomaly detection in IP traffic.

I am broadly interested in **recommender systems, interaction streams modelisation, data analysis**, and **anomaly detection**
