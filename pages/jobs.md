If you are interested in doing an internship with me, please contact me. I am happy to work with new people, from undergraduate students to PhD candidates.
You can mention one of the offers below, but we can also discuss of a topic that matches both our interests.

Internships typically last 3 months, are remunerated, and include plane tickets from your country of origin to France.
